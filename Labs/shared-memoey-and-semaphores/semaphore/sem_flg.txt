Structure Definition:

c

struct sembuf {
    unsigned short sem_num;  // Semaphore index in the set
    short sem_op;            // Semaphore operation
    short sem_flg;           // Operation flags
};

    struct sembuf is a structure defined in <sys/sem.h> for operations on POSIX semaphores (semop).

Members:

    sem_num: Specifies the index of the semaphore within the semaphore set on which the operation is to be performed.
    sem_op: Specifies the semaphore operation to perform (-1 for decrement, 1 for increment, or custom values).
    sem_flg: Specifies flags that control aspects of the semaphore operation.

Possible Flag Values:

    SEM_UNDO: This flag enables automatic undoing of semaphore operations when the process exits or terminates due to a signal. It ensures that operations are undone if the process holding the semaphore terminates abnormally.
    IPC_NOWAIT: This flag causes semop to return immediately with an error (EAGAIN) if the semaphore operation cannot be performed immediately (i.e., the semaphore value is not currently zero for a decrement operation).
    Other system-specific flags may exist depending on the operating system and its implementation of semaphores.

Common Usage:

    SEM_UNDO: Useful to prevent semaphores from being held indefinitely due to abnormal process termination. It ensures that semaphore adjustments are automatically reversed upon process termination.
    IPC_NOWAIT: Allows non-blocking semaphore operations, useful in scenarios where immediate completion of the operation is required without waiting for the semaphore to become available.

Example Usage:

c

sb.sem_num = 0;      // Semaphore index
sb.sem_op = -1;      // Decrement semaphore value
sb.sem_flg = SEM_UNDO;  // Enable automatic undoing of semaphore operations

    In this example, sb.sem_flg = SEM_UNDO; ensures that any changes made to the semaphore (sem_num = 0) are automatically reversed if the process terminates abnormally.
